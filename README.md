# The Odin Project - Landing Page
A simple landing page that uses different HTML and CSS elements, specifically flexbox and its uses. This project is part of The Odin Project curriculum.

Inspired by the local Filipino artists, this landing page showcases some of my favorite playlists found in Spotify.
